           <h3>Flexible Options</h3> 

Multipurpose furniture and mixed use rooms are trending in 2024. With our changing lifestyles it is no surprise that we need to make the best use of the space in our homes. Dedicated guest rooms have now become multipurpose spaces as a home office by day with a sofabed for overnight guests by night. Lift-top coffee tables in the living room transform into a place for a laptop when needed.

<h3>Choices</h3> 

Now that many name brand furniture manufacturers provide more options for buyers, custom furniture is no longer an out-of-reach luxury for just a few. Look for custom options so you can design a sofa in the size that fits your space with arm, pillow and leg choices. Families with young children and pets can opt for beautiful performance fabrics that stand up to heavy use.
